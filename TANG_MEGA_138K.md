# MiSTeryNano on Tang Mega 138K

MiSTeryNano can be used in the [Tang Mega 138K](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-mega-138k/mega-138k-pro.html).

The Tang Mega 138K is a big and expensive board. Unlike the Tang Nano
20K which is actually slightly inferior to the original MiST, the Tang
Mega 138K is even slightly more powerful than the MiST's successor
MiSTer. So while the MiSTeryNano core does run on the Tang Mega 138K
it only utilizes its FPGA to 14%.

Besides the significantly bigger FPGA over the Tang Nano 20K and also
the Tang Primer 25K, the Tang Mega 138K adds several more features of
which some can be used in the area of retro computing as well. This
includes a LCD screen directly mounted to the Tang Mega 138K Dock. The
MiSTeryNano core supports this as well.

Although the Tang Mega 138K comes with a significant ammount of
DDR3-SDRAM, it also comes with a slot for the [Tang
SDRAM](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-PMOD/FPGA_PMOD.html#TANG_SDRAM). Using this board allows to use the same SDR-SDRAM memory access
methods. DDR3 on the other hand is not supported by regular retro
implementations like the MiSTeryNano.

The M0S required to control the MiSTeryNano is to be mounted in the
middle PMOD with the help of the [M0S PMOD adapter](board/m0s_pmod).

The whole setup will look like this:

The firmware for the M0S Dock is the [same version as for the Tang
Nano 20K](firmware/misterynano_fw/).

On the software side the setup is very simuilar to the original Tang Nano 20K based solution. The core needs to be built specifically
for the different FPGA of the Tang Primer using either the [TCL script with the GoWin command line interface](src/build_tm138k.tcl) or the
[project file for the graphical GoWin IDE](src/atarist_tm138k.gprj). The resulting bitstream is flashed to the TM138K as usual.

Since the Tang Mega 138K needs a bigger portion of the available flash
memory space, the TOS ROMs need to be flashed to a different memory location
on the TM138K. The flash locations to be used on the Tang Mega 138K are:

| Address | TOS slot  |
|---------|-----------|
| 0x900000 | Primary ST TOS |
| 0x940000 | Primary STE TOS |
| 0x980000 | Secondary ST TOS |
| 0x9c0000 | Secondary STE TOS |
